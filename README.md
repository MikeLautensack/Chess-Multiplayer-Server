## Why did I build a multiplayer chess app?

During the pandemic, I picked up chess as a hobby, spending a lot of time playing on chess.com before transitioning to over-the-board games at local clubs. It was through playing chess at a local club that I met a friend who was a programmer and shared my love for the game. At the time, I wasn't yet a programmer myself.

One day, while playing over the board with my friend, I mentioned my desire to change careers. He brought to my attention the self-taught programmer career path. Intrigued, I asked him how exactly I should go about becoming a self-taught programmer. His advice was clear: build some great projects and display them on a portfolio.

The first idea that came to mind was to build a multiplayer chess platform similar to chess.com or lichess.org. This repository is the beginning of that platform.
